# Stanis≈Çaw Nieradko's CV

Repository with my CV and its LaTeX template.

CV is heavily inspired by [PlushCV](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/plushcv/jybpnsftmdkf/) but I have completly rewritten the whole design and added my personal tweaks.

## How to run?

To build your own version of this CV, you need to download and configure latex compiler on your system.

Template is written to run under `xelatex`.

Best way to edit this template is to use `vscode` with `vscode-latex-workshop` extension installed.
